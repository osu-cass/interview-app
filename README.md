# interview-app
An open-book, take-home programming project for SoftDev applicants.

## How to use this application as a part of the interview process:
To include this project in your application materials, you simply need to make sure that you are able to access it 
and run it in Visual Studio's Debug mode at the time of your interview. This may be done either on a machine that 
you will bring to your interview or on an internet-connected workstation that we will provide. 

Please refer to [github's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) for assistance 
acquiring your own copy of the project.

## How to use this application during the code editing process:
interview-app emulates an unfinished data analyzer tool. The finished version of the program will read a .csv file 
with data in it and performs some logic on that data. To learn more about how interview-app should function, read
the source code carefully, paying close attention to the `TODO:` comments   and `<summary>` blocks.

Please complete the application to the best of your abilities and be prepared to show us your work during your 
interview.

**Note:** We highly recommend that you use Visual Studio 2012 or later to work with this project as it is a C# project. 
However, you may work with any tool set you like as long as you are able to demonstrate your version of 
interview-app during your interview.
